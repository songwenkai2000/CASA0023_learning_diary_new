# Abstract

Remote sensing involves acquiring information about Earth's surface through the measurement and analysis of electromagnetic radiation emitted or reflected from the surface without direct contact. Central to this process is the electromagnetic spectrum, encompassing wavelengths from ultraviolet, visible, and infrared to microwave, each interacting differently with atmospheric constituents and terrestrial surfaces. Upon encountering Earth's atmosphere, electromagnetic radiation undergoes scattering processes such as Rayleigh, Mie, and non-selective scattering, affecting both data quality and interpretation. Understanding these scattering mechanisms is critical for effective atmospheric correction and accurate surface interpretation.

Once radiation reaches Earth's surface, it interacts through reflection, absorption, and transmission. These interactions produce unique spectral signatures that enable identification of various land-cover types such as vegetation, soil, water bodies, and urban features. To effectively capture and utilize these interactions, remote sensing sensors possess four critical types of resolutions: spectral, spatial, temporal, and radiometric. Spectral resolution allows differentiation between wavelengths, aiding in distinguishing materials based on their spectral signatures. Spatial resolution determines the detail level or smallest discernible feature size. Temporal resolution defines the revisit frequency, crucial for monitoring dynamic changes, while radiometric resolution refers to the sensor’s sensitivity in detecting small differences in emitted or reflected radiation, influencing image detail and precision.

Platforms like Landsat and Sentinel satellites provide global datasets balancing these resolutions, supporting extensive research in environmental monitoring, agriculture, forestry, and urban planning. Landsat, offering moderate-resolution imagery, facilitates long-term environmental studies, while Sentinel missions provide higher spatial and temporal resolution data, significantly improving precision in detailed land-use applications. Sentinel data are accessed primarily through the Copernicus Browser, a user-friendly platform offering efficient data retrieval and analysis, enhancing global data accessibility for diverse research needs.

# Application

Landsat and Sentinel datasets have significantly impacted environmental monitoring through practical applications in agriculture, forestry, and urban studies. For example, Landsat imagery has been extensively utilized for monitoring deforestation, urban expansion, and agricultural dynamics. Hansen et al. (2013) employed Landsat data globally to analyze forest loss and gain, leveraging Landsat’s moderate spatial and temporal resolutions to map changes consistently over three decades. By loading Landsat imagery and calculating spectral indices such as NDVI and NBR, researchers effectively monitored forest cover dynamics, supporting policy decisions on sustainable forestry management and biodiversity conservation.

Sentinel data accessed via the Copernicus Browser also support targeted, high-resolution applications. For instance, Sentinel-2's high spatial (10-20 m) and temporal (5-day revisit) resolution imagery has proven particularly effective in precision agriculture. Jin et al. (2022) demonstrated using Sentinel-2 data to estimate within-field wheat grain yield. Their approach involved acquiring Sentinel-2 imagery through Copernicus, computing vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI), and integrating these indices into regression models to predict grain yields accurately. This precise yield estimation facilitated optimized management strategies for farmers, enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability.

Similarly, Sentinel-1 radar data from Copernicus have supported forestry research. Schwartz et al. (2022) utilized Sentinel-1 radar backscatter data in conjunction with optical Sentinel-2 imagery to produce high-resolution forest canopy height maps using advanced deep learning techniques. This integration provided robust estimates of biomass and forest structural metrics crucial for carbon accounting and sustainable forest management practices. Thus, practical applications of Landsat and Sentinel datasets demonstrate substantial potential in addressing environmental challenges and informing decision-making across diverse sectors.

# Reflection

As an urban and rural planning student, engaging with remote sensing has been both intriguing and transformative for my academic perspective. Initially, I approached remote sensing as an entirely new discipline, with little exposure to concepts such as electromagnetic waves, atmospheric scattering processes, or sensor resolutions. However, learning about how electromagnetic radiation interacts uniquely with Earth's surfaces, creating distinctive spectral signatures, opened my eyes to the incredible potential of remote sensing technologies. Understanding these interactions, including scattering phenomena like Rayleigh and Mie scattering, has significantly improved my ability to interpret and analyze remotely sensed imagery accurately.

The exploration of Landsat and Sentinel datasets particularly fascinated me, as these satellites provide comprehensive global imagery vital for detailed environmental analyses and effective spatial planning. The practical process of accessing Sentinel data through the user-friendly Copernicus Browser inspired me, making me appreciate the power and accessibility of modern satellite data. Nonetheless, mastering these platforms required overcoming technical challenges such as understanding sensor characteristics, handling complex atmospheric corrections, and conducting rigorous accuracy assessments.

Moving forward, my interest in urban and regional development aligns perfectly with the capabilities provided by Sentinel and Landsat imagery. My future research might focus on monitoring urban sprawl, evaluating land-use changes, and assessing ecological impacts in rapidly urbanizing areas, integrating remote sensing techniques with urban spatial models. I envision using Sentinel's high-resolution imagery accessed via Copernicus for precision planning, sustainable land management, and optimizing urban green infrastructure design.

Overall, this course has profoundly shaped my analytical and technical skills, equipping me to tackle real-world urban planning challenges with innovative, data-driven methods. I am excited about the opportunities that remote sensing will offer my future research, and I'm committed to deepening my expertise in these technologies to support sustainable urban and regional development effectively.
