title: "Chapter 4: Policy - Jakarta Flood Management and Mangrove Restoration"
---

# Abstract

Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital city, is increasingly vulnerable to severe flooding due to heavy rainfall, rapid urbanization, land subsidence, climate change, and inadequate drainage infrastructure. Frequent flooding events have exacerbated environmental degradation, particularly impacting mangrove wetlands—critical natural barriers protecting urban areas. Mangrove degradation not only reduces biodiversity but also weakens the city’s resilience against future floods. Flood-driven land degradation, combined with ongoing land-use transformations and climatic variability, presents significant environmental policy challenges. Effective management and restoration of mangrove ecosystems thus become essential components of sustainable urban strategies. Addressing these interconnected issues requires comprehensive monitoring approaches to inform targeted interventions, policy-making, and strategic urban development.

Jakarta, as part of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, has implemented multiple policies to mitigate flooding. These policies include the Jakarta Coastal Defence Strategy and Flood Mapping initiative, limiting groundwater extraction, providing alternative water supplies, and developing water retention basins. The city also launched the Socially Inclusive Climate Adaptation for Urban Revitalization Project, relocating residents from flood-prone areas and revitalizing reservoirs to enhance water storage. Additionally, Jakarta aims to increase green open spaces from 10% to 30% by 2030, constructing parks to reduce flood duration and improve life quality.

# Application

Remote sensing technologies strongly support Jakarta’s flood management policies, particularly targeting mangrove wetland degradation from flooding events. Following methodologies exemplified by Adhikari et al. (2022), advanced remote sensing analyses can enable effective monitoring and restoration strategies.

Firstly, high-resolution multispectral imagery from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellites, accessed via Copernicus and USGS platforms, provides essential datasets for mangrove classification and monitoring. Utilizing the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, classification models are trained by collecting representative mangrove and wetland vegetation samples within Jakarta, recommending 15-20 training samples per class. Model optimization includes parameters such as unlimited decision-tree depth, selecting two variables per split, and building up to 300 trees.

Post-classification techniques include using NDVI thresholding to filter vegetation areas, ensuring accurate separation of mangroves from terrestrial vegetation. Visual interpretation corrects misclassifications. Assessing mangrove degradation involves calculating dynamic change rates with the land-use dynamic degree formula and generating land-use transition matrices to observe mangrove conversion into other land uses. The Landscape Intrusion Index (LII) further measures urban encroachment into mangrove zones, highlighting priority intervention areas.

To identify mangrove restoration priorities, maximum wetland extents are extracted efficiently using spectral indices (NDVI, NDBI, MNDWI, SMMI). The OTSU algorithm and decision-tree methods exclude urban built-up areas, isolating relevant wetland habitats. Deep learning models like APSMnet—incorporating ResConv and Transformer modules—improve mangrove classification accuracy by capturing local and long-range spatial dependencies. Priority assessment integrates mangrove degradation (LII and AWLII indices), land-use transitions, and existing urban policies, clearly delineating high, medium, and low-priority restoration zones. These techniques empower Jakarta policymakers in effective decision-making on environmental resilience and mangrove restoration.

# Reflection

Examining Jakarta’s environmental and urban development policies provided me with valuable insights into urban resilience and sustainability. The city's frequent floods reflect deeper governance and policy challenges—rapid urbanization without safeguarding essential natural buffers like mangroves illustrates the limitations of reactive environmental management. Jakarta’s policies, such as restricting groundwater extraction and expanding green spaces, are commendable but require effective enforcement, community involvement, and integration with broader urban and regional plans.

I realize the complexity in balancing urban development needs and environmental sustainability. The success of Jakarta’s mangrove restoration initiatives and flood resilience strategies depends heavily on local institutional support, sustained community engagement, and cross-sectoral cooperation. Mangrove degradation driven by flooding is interconnected with socioeconomic factors, requiring holistic approaches that include sustainable land use incentives and strengthened regulatory frameworks to achieve lasting impacts.

Jakarta's engagement with international networks like C40 demonstrates the significance of sharing knowledge and strategies across global cities. However, localizing global strategies to address Jakarta’s unique environmental, social, and political contexts is critical. Effective mangrove restoration and flood management strategies must be informed by accurate remote sensing data and proactive policy design to create a resilient and sustainable urban future. Ultimately, achieving environmental policy goals hinges on collective stakeholder commitment to prioritizing environmental health alongside economic development.
